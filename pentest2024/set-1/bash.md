THE FIRST QUESTION IN BASH SCRIPTING.
in the question they askedto take 2 numbers and perform operations according to the user choice.
Actually i did the code part in live editor and named it asc (calculator.sh) then used 'chmod +x calculator.sh' and './calculator.sh' to get the output in the terminal
The code:

#!/bin/bash

display_menu() {
    echo "Select an operation:"
    echo "1. Addition"0
    echo "2. Subtraction"
    echo "3. Multiplication"
    echo "4. Division"
    echo "5. Average"
    echo -n "Enter your choice (1-5): "
}

perform_addition() {
    local num1=$1
    local num2=$2
    echo "Result: $(echo "$num1 + $num2" | bc)"
}

perform_subtraction() {
    local num1=$1
    local num2=$2
    echo "Result: $(echo "$num1 - $num2" | bc)"
}

perform_multiplication() {
    local num1=$1
    local num2=$2
    echo "Result: $(echo "$num1 * $num2" | bc)"
}

perform_division() {
    local num1=$1
    local num2=$2
    if [ "$num2" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
    else
        echo "Result: $(echo "scale=2; $num1 / $num2" | bc)"
    fi
}

perform_average() {
    local num1=$1
    local num2=$2
    echo "Result: $(echo "scale=2; ($num1 + $num2) / 2" | bc)"
}

echo -n "Enter the first number: "
read num1
echo -n "Enter the second number: "
read num2

display_menu
read choice

case $choice in
    1) perform_addition $num1 $num2 ;;
    2) perform_subtraction $num1 $num2 ;;
    3) perform_multiplication $num1 $num2 ;;
    4) perform_division $num1 $num2 ;;
    5) perform_average $num1 $num2 ;;
    *) echo "Invalid choice. Please select a number between 1 and 5." ;;
esac
THE OUTPUT SCRRENSHOT I WILL KEEP IT IN THE SCREENSHOTS FILE.

SECOND QUESTION IN BASH SCRIPTING
It is said to check whether a number is a palindrome or not .
PALINDROME means the words which read the same from left or right . as these are case senstitive we need change uper to lower case
the code is used:
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number: " num

if ! [[ $num =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
	echo "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number."
	exit 1
fi

reverse=$(echo $num | rev)
if [ "$num" = "$reverse" ];then
	echo "The number $num is a palindrome."
else
	echo "The number $num is not a palindrome."
fi
THE OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS I WILL KRRP IT IN THE SCREENSHOTS FILE

THIRD QUESTION IN BASH SCRIPTING
it is said to run a operation by reading the input from the user the output will be a ROT13 encode or ROT13 decode on the choice of the user
ROT13 encode and decode means each letter whether it is lower or uppercase will move 13 positions furthur means A or a the output N or n.
the code i used:
#!/bin/bash

rot13(){
     echo "$1" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
}
read -p "Enter the text: " text
echo "Choose an option."
echo "1.ROT13 Encode"
echo "2.ROT13 Decode."
read -p "Enter your choice ( 1 or 2):" choice

if [ "$choice" -eq 1 ];then 
     result=$(rot13 "$text")
     echo "Encoded text:
$result"
elif [ "$choice" -eq 2 ];
then
    result=$(rot13 "$text")
    echo "Decoded text:
$result"
else
    echo "Invalid choice.
please select 1 or 2."
fi
THE OUTPUT I KEPT IN THE SCREENSHOTS FILE

FOURTH QUESTION IN BASH SCRIPTING
To find a file persistence is present in my system.
the code i used:
#!/bin/bash
check_file_existence(){
	local persistence="$1"
	if [ -f "$persistence" ]; then
		echo "the file '$persistence' exists."
	else
		echo "the file '$persistence' exists."
	fi
}
check_file_existence "$persistence"
IN THE OUTPUT SCREENSHOT I KEPT IN SCREENSHOT FILE WILL COME AS THE FILE EXITS AS I CREATED THE FILE IN MY SYSTEM

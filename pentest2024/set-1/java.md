    • JAVA CODE:
       public class Main {
      	public static void main(String[] args) {
      		System.out.println(“”);
          }
      }
    • Every java application begins with this code . Here the classnmame is Main it refers to the file
    • a code should alway start with a uppercase letter or a _ . Java is case sensitive.
    • The name of the java file must match the class name when saving it using the classname with .java extension
    • in ‘System.out.println();” the system is a built in function , out is output for ‘output’ the println is short for print line used  to print the values in the output screen.
    • The semi colon is important without this it gives an error.
    • To print a number quotes are not required.
    • Import java.util*.; is used to import packages .The * symbol represents a wildcard, indicating that all classes/interfaces within the java.util package should be imported.
    • public class Main {
      	public static void main(String[] args) {
      		 System.out.println("Code" + "Chef");
      
      	}
      } if we use this ("Code" + "Chef") then the output will come without spaces between it.to get space between use:("Code" + “” + "Chef"); or  ("Code " + "Chef"); or ("Code" + " Chef"); the ‘+’ operator can also be used to add one string and one int
    • “\n” is used to print the next sumber or string in the next line.
    • System.out.println(3 + " - " + (3 * 3)); the output willbe 9 as the code is used to get the square of the numbers.
    • int age = 25; it specifies that the number 25 is under the variable age.
    • Char ch = ‘b’ in this way we can declare a char variable.
    • Double area = 3.9 in this way the variable of type double is declared. Similarly we can store vaues by declaring other variables. 
    •   Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
              int a = read.nextInt();
              int b = read.nextInt();
              int c = a + b;
              System.out.print(c); is used to perform addition of two number.
    • The scope of code is defined by using ‘curly braces’.
    • The role of ‘else if’ in an if-else ladder is to check aan additional condition if none of the pervious conditions are true.
    • The purpose of the if-else if-else ladder is to check multiple conditions sequentially.
    • int count = 0;
      while (count < 5) {
          System.out.print(count + " ");
          count++;
      }this code gives the output from 0 to 4 with spaces i.e 0 1 2 3 4.
    • do-w.hile loop are different from the while loop as do-while loop executes the code block at least once, even if the conditions is false initially.
    • public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
              int x = 0;
              do {
                  System.out.print(x + " ");
                  x += 2;
              } while (x < 5);
          }
      } the output of the code is 024 as the loop say that form x=0 plus it with 2 then we get 2 then again add 2 to the numbber then we get 4 the loop says that upto where x is less then 5 so it will stop at 4 . the output will be 0 2 4.
    • in a while loop the condition get evaluated before each iteration.if the initial condition of a while loop is false then the loop is skipped and the code inside is not executed.
    • public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
              int x = 1;
              while (x > 0) {
                  System.out.print(x);
                  x = x + 1;
              }
          }
      }this code is an example of a infinite loop
      in a do-while loop the condition gets evaluated after each iteration and if it is true, the loop is executed again else the loop os exited.

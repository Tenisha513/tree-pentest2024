    • login with SSH for bandit0 password was bandit0(given)
    • As per the question, by using ls command we get a file named readme then by 
     using .
    • Then we have to  get the content in readme file  i.e the password in that 
     file
    • I used  'cat' to read the text inside the file i.e the password:
    • Bandit0 - first password = ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
      .
      LEVEL-2
    • login with the SSH for bandit1 with the password before by reading the readme       file.
    • As per the question , the passowrd is in a file ‘-’ 
    • first i used ‘ls’ command we get a file named '-' .second to read the text 
     inside it we use ‘cat’ command but when i first used it there was not output .
    • Again  (by ctrl + c) i came back to check where i got it wrong.i found that '-' it typically refers to reading from standard input rather than a file.
    • So after to read the txt in the file used cat command :‘cat./- .  ‘./’ is 
     used  to specify the the path of the current directory '-' then we get the 
       password: 
    • bandit1 -second password = 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
      
      LEVEL-3
    • login with SSH for bandit2 password to login into this level with the p
     assword before by reading the '-' file.
    • According to the question, the password is inside the file named “spaces in 
     this filename” .
    • First i thought for a while about the file name . Then by using ‘ls’ command 
     i found that the file name was actually “spaces in this filename”.
    • Then to read the txt in the file ‘cat’ command : cat "spaces in this 
     filename" . I got the password: 
    • bandit2-third password = Mnk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
      
      LEVEL-4
    • login with SSH for bandit3 password to login into this level is the password 
     before.
    • According to the question, we have to get the password from a hidden file in 
      inhere directory .
    • First i checked if inhere directory i present in my home dirctory by ‘ls’ 
      command .
    • Then by using ‘cd’ command  i have gone to  inhere directory to see all the 
    files in the directory  I used  ls-a(it is used to see hidden files ) then we 
     get as: ‘ .  ..  .hiding-from-you’
    • Then used cat command to read the text in the file : cat ...hiding-from-you .
     we get the password:
    • bandit3- fouth password= 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
      
      LEVEL-5
    • Login with the SSH for bandit4 password to login into it is the password 
      before by reading the hidden file in inhere directory.
    • According to the question, the password is present in a human-readable file 
     in inhere directory
    • then i found that most common data encodings that are human-readable are ASII
    and unicode.
    • as the level3 i went to inhere directory by using  ‘cd ‘ command.
    • By using the commad ls-la all the files and directories including the hidden 
     files were shown we get a total 48files in these 10 files an be see as 
      bandit4.
    • Now to have find the file which is human-readable file First i used ‘file 
     ./*’ we get the 10 files in  which only one was : file07 is of type ASII text 
      . Then i got to  know that ASII text are one of the encoding that humans can 
       read. Then to read the text inside it i used ‘cat’ command: cat ./-file07  
        we get the password:
    • bandit4-fifth password = 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
      
      LEVEL-6
    • login with the SSH for bandit5 password to login into is the passowrd before 
     by reading the file07.
    • According to the question, the password for the next level is stored in file 
     in inhere directory which has the properties: human-readable,1033 bytes in 
      size,not executable.
    • first i went to the inhere directory .To see all the files i used ls-la 
     command to get the details of all the files including the hidden files a total      of 88 files were shown.
    • Then i went through the properties and found  ‘du’ command is used to find 
     the file size in bytes and to find non-excutable find command can be used with      -executable flag with ‘!’ negotation. 
    • To find the file with the properties we use: du -b -a | grep 1033 . 
    • Then we get the path of the file we are looking for then use cat command: cat
    ./maybehere07/.file2. we get the password:
    • bandit5-sixth password = HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
      
      LEVEL-7
    • login with SSH  for bandit6 with password before by reading the file: 
     ./maybehere07/.file2.
    • According to the question, we have to find a file present some where in the 
    server with properties: owned by user bandit7,owned by froup bandit6, 33 bytes 
     in size
    • As each file is owned by a user and a group we can see who owned the file 
     both user and group. 
    •  the user and the group(given in the question) .i used the ‘find’ command to 
     know the where is the file is with the command : find / -user bandit7 -group 
      bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
    • here 2>/dev/null is used to avoid cluttering our output with permission 
     denied errors.
    • I got the location of file as : /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password.Then use 
    cat to read the text in the file to get the password:
    • bandit6-seventh password = morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
      
      LEVEL-8
    • Login with SSH for bandit7 password to login into is the password before by 
     reading the file 
    • According to the question the password is stored in the data file data.txt 
     next to the word millionth.
    • I though the password would also be in the same line as the millionth.
    •  So i used ‘cat’ command to  read the data.txt and used ‘grep’ (as it is used      to find specific  patterns of text within files or output)command: cat dat.txt      | grep millionth.we get the password:
    • bandit7-eighth password = dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
      
      LEVEL-9
    • Login with the SSH the password is the password before.
    • According to the question the password is stored in the file data.txt that is       the only line text that occurs only once.
    • By checking one after one command in the commands  which were given .I found 
     that ‘uniq’ command is used to filters the lines that only appear ones and 
    also there was another condition ‘uniq’ to filter the lines need to be sorted.
    • The command i use : sort data.txt | uniq -u and we get the password:
    • bandit8-ninth password = 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
      
      LEVEL-10
    • Login with the SSH for bandit9 with the password before.
    • According to the question the password is stored in the file data.txt in one 
     of the human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
    • By checking the command present i check and found that the sring command 
    finds human-readable strings in files and it's main use is for non-printable 
     file like hex dumps or executables.
    • The command i used : strings data.txt | grep === and we get the password:
    • bandit9-tenth password = FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
      
      LEVEL-11
    • Login with the SSH for bandit10 with the password before
    • According to the question,the password for the next level is stored in file 
     data.txt which contains base64 encoded data.
    • Base64 is a binary to a text encoding scheme that represents binry data in an      ASCII string format.it is used to carry data stored in binary format across 
     the channels it takes any form of data and transforma it into a long string of       plain text.
    • Base64 command allows files as input and base64 -d for decoding the command i      used base64 -d data.txt. The password:
    • bandit10-11password = dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
      
      LEVEL-12
    • Login with the SSH for bandit11 with the password before.
    • According to the question the password is stored in the file data.txt .where 
     all the letter lower and uppercase are moved by 13 position furthur(eg: A or a       = N or n) it’s also same as caesar cipher.rotated by 13 positions is the 
      ROT13 substitution cipher.
    • ‘tr’ command stands for translate . Theren is not build-in command of ROT13 
    command in linux the command i used:“cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'”
     the password:
    • bandit11-12password = 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
      
      LEVEL-13
    • Login with the SSH for bandit12 with the password before.
    • According to the questions the password is stored in the file data.txt which i     s a hex dump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed
    • ‘Hexdump’ is a tool that shows data from a file or data source in an easy to 
      read way.hex is easier to understand than binary.it has three main columns 
       first the address , second the hex representation of the data on that 
       address , third shows the actual data as strings(with ‘.’ being hex value 
       that can not be represented as a string.
    • gzip and bzip2 command is used to compress or decompress(-d) files it ends 
     with .gz and bzip2 ends with .bz2
    • tar commnad creates archive files(-cf) it also allows extracting these files 
     (-xf) end with .tar
    • by ls command go to new directory /tmp then copy data.txt to it and try to 
     decompress the hexdump file.used xxd command to convert the hexdump back to 
     binary format as data.txt contains the hexdump: xxd -r -p data.txt output_file
    • the command means xxd -r -p reads a plain hex dump and reverses it to binary 
     the output is stored in a file named output_file.then to compreesed gzip , 
     bzip2 i decompressed it upto i got the password by checking the file if it is 
     compressed or not.i got the password at data8.
    • Then use cat command to read the text the password is:
    • bandit12-13passwod = FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
      
      LEVEL-14
    • Login to bandit12 with the password before 
    • According to the question the password is stored in etcbandit_pass/bandit14 
     and can only be read by user14
    • the public key allows access to the user that owns the private key
    • i tried to see the content by using ls command then i saw sshkey.private  by 
    now the thing is to get the permission from the owner.
    • To set the permission from the owner the command : chmod 600 
     /path/to/private_key
    • to log into SSH key command: ssh -i sshkey.private -p  2220 
     bandit14@localhost. its asks as ‘are ypu sure of connecting’ type ‘yes’.then 
     bandit14 is opend .
    • The password will be stored in etcbandit_pass/bandit14 use cat cammand to 
     open it the password:
    •  bandit13-14password = MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
      
      LEVEL15
    • Login into the bandit13 with password before.
    • According to the question the password is to be retrieved by submitting the 
     password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.
    • The commnad nc or netcat is a command that allows to read and write data over       a network connection to connect to a hosta nd port nc <host> <port> is used 
      command used: ‘nc localhost 30000’ then press enter then enter the password 
      of level 14 then it will correct then you will get the pssword:
